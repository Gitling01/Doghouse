10/22/2024:
1- The registration is fully working (can register a user via the site into db)
2- The ability to add listings is fully working (can add a listing via the
site into the database)
3- WIP: The login is being worked on (the main server side logic is fully working -- to print "logged in" 
   to the console)(the client side route still needs to be added but login works via Insomnia)
   I still want to check that I am handling errors for all needed cases.
4- WIP: Stuff related to sessions is currently being added (session.js and server.js are being modified)

10/28/2024:
1- The session management backend (requiring login upon clicking the listing-form.html link) is working 
in Insomnia, but the client-side code has a bug (not working as expected when deployed)
2- Added a simple listing details page UI (everything hard coded so far) just listing-details.html and css  
3- The GET /listings route in server.js has been modified to take an optional listing_id parameter in the url
and is fully working in Insomnia. 
4- I have created a click listener for the listing views and added info about the listing_id into the 
listing container DOM elements. The click listener has logic that takes the user to the listing-details.html 
page.
5- I added a function that renders the listing-details page based on data in localStorage and also 
put a click listener on the dom content loaded for the listing-details page so the rendering function is 
called

RELATED TO SESSION MANAGEMENT AND AUTHENTICATION:
*Added credentials: 'include' in index.js functions loginUser and checkAuthentication
*Modified settings in server.js - cors uses origin: 'http://127.0.0.1:5501' and credentials: true.
*Modified settings in session in cookies - secure: true, httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'none'.
Newest browser error: "TypeError: a.default.detectStore(...) is undefined"
